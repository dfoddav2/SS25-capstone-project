  abstract = {Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) is a labeled immunoassay that is considered the gold standard of immunoassays. This immunological test is very sensitive and is used to detect and quantify substances, including antibodies, antigens, proteins, glycoproteins, and hormones. The detection of these products is accomplished by complexing antibodies and antigens to produce a measurable result. An~antibody~is a type of protein produced by an individual’s immune system. This protein type has specific regions that bind to antigens. An~antigen~is a protein that can come from some foreign source and, when bound to an antibody, induces a cascade of events through the body’s immune system. This interaction is utilized in ELISA testing and allows for identifying specific protein antibodies and antigens, with only small amounts of a test sample. ELISA testing is used to diagnose HIV infection, pregnancy tests, and blood typing, among others. This article will discuss the basic principles, procedures, and clinical significance of the ELISA.[1][2][3][4]},

In humans, induction of anti-PEG was observed following exposure to a PEG-conjugated drug, and pre-existing anti-PEG was identified in over 25\% the healthy population. In clinical studies, the presence of anti-PEG was strongly associated with rapid clearance of PEG-asparaginase and PEG-uricase. PEGylation of therapeutic agents will continue to be of significant value in medicine to reduce immunogenicity, antigenicity and toxicity as well as markedly reducing renal clearance, while maintaining drug efficacy. It is important to recognize that PEG itself may possess antigenic and immunogenic properties. Further comprehensive studies are warranted to fully elucidate the effect of anti-PEG on PEG-conjugated agents and if confirmed in a prospective trial, patients should be screened and monitored for anti-PEG, and strategies developed to overcome the potential negative effect of anti-PEG on drug clearance to improve the effectiveness of therapy.},

  abstract = {Due to the large growth in the number of cars being bought and sold, used-car price prediction creates a lot of interest in analysis and research. The availability of used cars in developing countries results in an increased choice of used vehicles, and people increasingly choose used vehicles over new ones, which causes shortages. There is an important need to explore the enormous amount of valuable data generated by vehicle sellers. All sellers usually have the imminent need of finding a better way to predict the future behavior of prices, which helps in determining the best time to buy or sell, in order to achieve the best profit. This paper provides an overview of data-driven models for estimating the price of used vehicles in the Croatian market using correlated attributes, in terms of production year and kilometers traveled. In order to achieve this, the technique of data mining from the online seller “Njuškalo” was used. Redundant and missing values were removed from the data set during data processing. Using the method of supervised machine learning, with the use of a linear regression algorithm for predicting the prices of used cars and comparing the accuracy with the classification algorithm, the purpose of this paper is to describe the state of the vehicle market and predict price trends based on available attributes. Prediction accuracy increases with training the model with the second data set, where price growth is predicted by linear regression with a prediction accuracy of 95\%. The experimental analysis shows that the proposed model predicts increases in vehicle prices and decreases in the value of vehicles regarding kilometers traveled, regardless of the year of production. The average value of the first data set is a personal vehicle with 130,000 km traveled and a price of EUR 10,000. The second set of data was extracted 3 months after the previously analyzed set, and the average price of used vehicles increased by EUR 1391 per vehicle. On the other hand, average kilometers traveled decreased by 8060 km, which justifies the increase in prices and validates the training models. The price and vehicle type are features that play an important role in predicting the price in a second-hand market, which seems to be given less importance in the current literature of prediction models.},

However, little is studied on the comparison of using different algorithms in used car price estimation. This paper collects more than 100,000 used car dealing records throughout China to do empirical analysis on a thorough comparison of two algorithms: linear regression and random forest. These two algorithms are used to predict used car price in three different models: model for a certain car make, model for a certain car series and universal model. Results show that random forest has a stable but not ideal effect in price evaluation model for a certain car make, but it shows great advantage in the universal model compared with linear regression. This indicates that random forest is an optimal algorithm when handling complex models with a large number of variables and samples, yet it shows no obvious advantage when coping with simple models with less variables.},

First, the relevant data processing is carried out for the initial recognition features. Then, by training the deep residual network, the predicted results are fused with the original features as new features. Finally, the new feature group is input into the iteration framework for training, the iteration is stopped, and the results are output when the performance reaches the highest value. These experimental results show that the combination of the deep residual network and iterative framework has a better prediction accuracy than the random forest and deep residual network. At the same time, by combining the existing mainstream methods with the iterative framework, it is verified that the iterative framework proposed in this paper can be applied to other models and greatly improve the prediction performance of other models.},

  abstract = {This assessment focusses on polyethylene glycols (PEGs) and on anionic or nonionic PEG derivatives, which are currently used in cosmetics in Europe. These compounds are used in a great variety of cosmetic applications because of their solubility and viscosity properties, and because of their low toxicity. The PEGs, their ethers, and their fatty acid esters produce little or no ocular or dermal irritation and have extremely low acute and chronic toxicities. They do not readily penetrate intact skin, and in view of the wide use of preparations containing PEG and PEG derivatives, only few case reports on sensitisation reactions have been published, mainly involving patients with exposure to PEGs in medicines or following exposure to injured or chronically inflamed skin. On healthy skin, the sensitising potential of these compounds appears to be negligible. For some representative substances of this class, information was available on reproductive and developmental toxicity, on genotoxicty and carcinogenic properties. Taking into consideration all available information from related compounds, as well as the mode and mechanism of action, no safety concern with regard to these endpoints could be identified. Based on the available data it is therefore concluded that PEGs of a wide molecular weight range (200 to over 10,000), their ethers (laureths. ceteths, ceteareths, steareths, and oleths), and fatty acid esters (laurates, dilaurates, stearates, distearates) are safe for use in cosmetics. Limited data were available for PEG sorbitan/sorbitol fatty acid esters, PEG sorbitan beeswax and PEG soy sterols. Taking into account all the information available for closely related compounds, it can be assumed that these compounds as presently used in cosmetic preparations will not present a risk for human health. PEG castor oils and PEG hydrogenated castor oils have caused anaphylactic reactions when used in intravenous medicinal products. Their topical use in cosmetics is, however, considered safe as they are not expected to be systemically available. As all PEGs and PEG derivatives, they must not be applied to damaged skin. Manufacturers of PEGs and PEG derivatives must continue their efforts to remove impurities and by-products such as ethylene oxide and 1,4-dioxane. Overall, it is concluded, that the PEGs covered in this review are safe for use in cosmetics under the present conditions of intended use.},

To date, 11 PEGylated biopharmaceuticals have been approved and there is indication that many more are in nonclinical or clinical development. Adverse effects seen with those in toxicology studies are mostly related to the active part of the drug molecule and not to polyethylene glycol (PEG). In 5 of the 11 approved and 10 of the 17 PEGylated biopharmaceuticals in a 2013 industry survey presented here, cellular vacuolation is histologically observed in toxicology studies in certain organs and tissues. No other effects attributed to PEG alone have been reported. Importantly, vacuolation, which occurs mainly in phagocytes, has not been linked with changes in organ function in these toxicology studies. This article was authored through collaborative efforts of industry toxicologists/nonclinical scientists to address the nonclinical safety of large PEG molecules ({$>$}10 kilo Dalton) in PEGylated biopharmaceuticals. The impact of the PEG molecule on overall nonclinical safety assessments of PEGylated biopharmaceuticals is discussed, and toxicological information from a 2013 industry survey on PEGylated biopharmaceuticals under development is summarized. Results will contribute to the database of toxicological information publicly available for PEG and PEGylated biopharmaceuticals.},

Today, PEGylation of proteins is a well-established technology and is being used in the treatment of a variety of clinical disorders. Several PEGylated coagulation proteins for haemophilia A and B are under development with the goal of prolonging the circulation half-life of factor VIII (FVIII) or factor IX. The prolongation of half-life, resulting in less frequent injections can provide significant benefits in improving the quality of life of subjects with haemophilia and improvement in adherence to treatment. A review of published literature on PEGylated therapeutic products currently approved for human use and a discussion of a PEGylated recombinant FVIII molecule (BAY 94–9027, Bayer HealthCare, Berkeley, CA, USA) currently being investigated in the pivotal clinical trial prior to registration is provided. Available safety information of PEGylated proteins containing high molecular weight PEG does not indicate any safety concerns to date, following long-term (chronic) use in animal models or patients. Chronic use of currently available PEGylated products has been shown to be safe, paving the way for chronic use of PEGylated coagulation products in persons with haemophilia.},

This model can benefit sellers, buyers, and car manufacturers in the used cars market. Upon completion, it can output a relatively accurate price prediction based on the information that users input. The model building process involves machine learning and data science. The dataset used was scraped from listings of used cars. Various regression methods, including linear regression, polynomial regression, support vector regression, decision tree regression, and random forest regression, were applied in the research to achieve the highest accuracy. Before the actual start of model-building, this project visualized the data to understand the dataset better. The dataset was divided and modified to fit the regression, thus ensure the performance of the regression. To evaluate the performance of each regression, R-square was calculated. Among all regressions in this project, random forest achieved the highest R-square of 0.90416. Compared to previous research, the resulting model includes more aspects of used cars while also having a higher prediction accuracy.},

  abstract = {Conjugation of polyethylene glycols (PEGs) to proteins or drug delivery nanosystems is a widely accepted method to increase the therapeutic index of complex nano-biopharmaceuticals. Nevertheless, these drugs and agents are often immunogenic, triggering the rise of anti-drug antibodies (ADAs). Among these ADAs, anti-PEG IgG and IgM were shown to account for efficacy loss due to accelerated blood clearance of the drug (ABC phenomenon) and hypersensitivity reactions (HSRs) entailing severe allergic symptoms with occasionally fatal anaphylaxis. In addition to recapitulating the basic information on PEG and its applications, this review expands on the physicochemical factors influencing its immunogenicity, the prevalence, features, mechanism of formation and detection of anti-PEG IgG and IgM and the mechanisms by which these antibodies (Abs) induce ABC and HSRs. In particular, we highlight the in vitro, animal and human data attesting to anti-PEG Ab-induced complement (C) activation as common underlying cause of both adverse effects. A main message is that correct measurement of anti-PEG Abs and individual proneness for C activation might predict the rise of adverse immune reactions to PEGylated drugs and thereby increase their efficacy and safety.},

Accurate used car price prediction can help people make correct decisions and avoid the wanton price tag of used cars in the market as much as possible. This paper uses the random forest and LightGBM algorithms to predict the price of used cars and compares and analyzes the prediction results. The experiments found that the relevant evaluation indicators of the random forest and LightGBM models are as follows: MSE is 0.0373 and 0.0385 respectively; MAE is 0.125 and 0.117 respectively; The R square of prediction is 0.936 and 0.933 respectively. Among the two prediction models, the prediction error of the LightGBM model is smaller, and it can be considered to be applied to other fields in future research.},

  abstract = {As the mobile Internet improves by leaps and bounds, the model of traditional offline used car trading has gradually lost the ability to live up to the needs of consumers, and online used car trading platforms have emerged as the times require. Second-hand car price assessment is the premise of second-hand car trading, and a reasonable price can reflect the objective, fair, and true nature of the second-hand car market. In order to standardize the evaluation standards of used car prices and improve the accuracy of used car price forecasts, the linear correlation between vehicle parameters, vehicle conditions, and transaction factors and used car price was comprehensively investigated, grey relational analysis was applied to filter the feature variables of factors affecting used car price, the traditional BP neural network was also optimized by combining the particle swarm optimization algorithm, and a used car price prediction method based on PSO-GRA-BPNN was proposed. The results show that only the correlation coefficient of new car price, engine power, and used car price is greater than 0.6, which has a certain linear correlation. The correlation between new car price, displacement, mileage, gearbox type, fuel consumption, and registration time on used car prices is greater than 0.7, and the impact of other indicators on used car prices is negligible. Compared with the traditional BPNN model and the multiple linear regression, random forest, and support vector machine regression models proposed by other researchers, the MAPE of the PSO-GRA-BPNN model proposed in this paper is 3.936\%, which is 30.041\% smaller than the error of the other three models. The MAE of the PSO-GRA-BPNN model is 0.475, which is a maximum reduction of 0.622 compared to the other three models. R can reach up to 0.998, and R2 can reach 0.984. Although the longest training time is 94.153 s, the overall prediction effect is significantly better than other used car price prediction models, providing a new idea and method for used car evaluation.},

A respectable amount of work dealing with the technology acceptance model (TAM), from its first appearance more than a quarter of a century ago, clearly indicates a popularity of the model in the field of technology acceptance. Originated in the psychological theory of reasoned action and theory of planned behavior, TAM has evolved to become a key model in understanding predictors of human behavior toward potential acceptance or rejection of the technology. The main aim of the paper is to provide an up-to-date, well-researched resource of past and current references to TAM-related literature and to identify possible directions for future TAM research. The paper presents a comprehensive concept-centric literature review of the TAM, from 1986 onwards. According to a designed methodology, 85 scientific publications have been selected and classified according to their aim and content into three categories such as (i) TAM literature reviews, (ii) development and extension of TAM, and (iii) modification and application of TAM. Despite a continuous progress in revealing new factors with significant influence on TAM’s core variables, there are still many unexplored areas of model potential application that could contribute to its predictive validity. Consequently, four possible future directions for TAM research based on the conducted literature review and analysis are identified and presented.},

Studies give information about which algorithm is more successful in price prediction using different machine learning methods. The most commonly used method for price prediction is the linear regression model. In our study, we examined the effectiveness of the linear regression model for used car price prediction. In our study, we applied the linear regression model on a data set that includes the features and price information of vehicles in Turkey for the year 2020. As a result, when we selected 1/3 of the data set as the test data, we observed that the R2 score for the prediction success of our model was 73\%. More successful results can be obtained with different data sets or a more detailed data preprocessing.},

There has been a steady increase in automobile production namely, passenger cars over the preceding decade with more than 70 million passenger cars being manufactured in 2016 itself. This has given rise to the resale automobile market, which has become a thriving business in its own right. Customers who are interested in purchasing a pre-owned car frequently face the difficulty in locating a vehicle that fits within their financial constraints as well as estimating the price of a specific pre-owned car. Customers can make more educated decisions regarding the purchase of a pre-owned car if they have access to accurate price projections for pre-owned cars. With the proliferation of digital marketplaces, both the buyer and the seller remain more updated regarding the recent market trends and patterns that impact the value of a used car. In this paper, we investigate this issue and propose a forecasting system using machine learning techniques that enables a prospective buyer to anticipate the price of a pre-owned vehicle of interest. The process is conducted with the collection and pre-processing of a dataset followed by an exploratory data analysis. Various machine learning regression techniques, such as Linear Regression, LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Extreme Gradient Boosting, have subsequently been implemented. The techniques are then compared so as to determine an optimal solution. Three types of errors namely, MAE, MSE and RMSE have also been calculated in order to determine the best-fitted model.},

  abstract = {Vehicle electrification, automation, and shared mobility – also referred to as the transportation three revolutions (3Rs) – are the emerging trends in future mobility. This study performed a comprehensive integrated analysis to investigate the potential future development of passenger transportation in the United States. A technical-economic mobility model, a chemical transport model, and a health impact assessment tool were utilized. This study first adopted several assumptions for vehicle sales under the impact of the 3Rs, and made projections to 2050 for vehicle stocks, distance travel, energy use, and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. This study then quantified the impacts of changing emissions on concentrations of fine particulate matter and associated health benefits. Compared to a projected 2050 business-as-usual case, the wide use of electrification could lead to reductions of \textasciitilde 50\% in petroleum consumption and \textasciitilde 75\% in CO2 emissions, and obtain health benefits of 5500 prevented premature deaths, corresponding to \$58 billion annually. The net energy impacts of automation are highly uncertain, and the improved efficiency from automation might be offset by an increase in travel. Sharing would bring additional benefits. The combination of the 3Rs could maximize the energy savings, carbon mitigations, and health benefits. The results of this study suggest that policies/incentives are needed to promote the transition from single-occupied conventional vehicles to shared electric vehicles.},

  abstract = {In the recent years, protein PEGylation has become an established and highly refined technology by moving forward from initial simple random coupling approaches based on conjugation at the level of lysine ε-amino group. Nevertheless, amino PEGylation is still yielding important conjugates, currently in clinical practice, where the degree of homogeneity was improved by optimizing the reaction conditions and implementing the purification processes. However, the current research is mainly focused on methods of site-selective PEGylation that allow the obtainment of a single isomer, thus highly increasing the degree of homogeneity and the preservation of bioactivity. Protein N-terminus and free cysteines were the first sites exploited for selective PEGylation but currently further positions can be addressed thanks to approaches like bridging PEGylation (disulphide bridges), enzymatic PEGylation (glutamines and C-terminus) and glycoPEGylation (sites of O- and N-glycosylation or the glycans of a glycoprotein). Furthermore, by combining the tools of genetic engineering with specific PEGylation approaches, the polymer can be basically coupled at any position on the protein surface, owing to the substitution of a properly chosen amino acid in the sequence with a natural or unnatural amino acid bearing an orthogonal reactive group. On the other hand, PEGylation has not achieved the same success in the delivery of small drugs, despite the large interest and several studies in this field. Targeted conjugates and PEGs for combination therapy might represent the promising answers for the so far unmet needs of PEG as carrier of small drugs. This review presents a thorough panorama of recent advances in the field of PEGylation.},

  abstract = {Poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) is a highly investigated polymer for the covalent modification of biological macromolecules and surfaces for many pharmaceutical and biotechnical applications. In the modification of biological macromolecules, peptides and proteins are of extreme importance. Reasons for PEGylation (i.e. the covalent attachment of PEG) of peptides and proteins are numerous and include shielding of antigenic and immunogenic epitopes, shielding receptor-mediated uptake by the reticuloendothelial system (RES), and preventing recognition and degradation by proteolytic enzymes. PEG conjugation also increases the apparent size of the polypeptide, thus reducing the renal filtration and altering biodistribution. An important aspect of PEGylation is the incorporation of various PEG functional groups that are used to attach the PEG to the peptide or protein. In this paper, we review PEG chemistry and methods of preparation with a particular focus on new (second-generation) PEG derivatives, reversible conjugation and PEG structures.},

  abstract = {The use of methoxypoly(ethylene glycol) (mPEG) in PEG conjugates of proteins and non-protein therapeutic agents has led to the recognition that the polymer components of such conjugates can induce anti-PEG antibodies (anti-PEGs) that may accelerate the clearance and reduce the efficacy of the conjugates. Others have classified anti-PEGs as “methoxy-specific” or “backbone-specific”. The results of our previous research on anti-PEGs in the sera of rabbits immunized with mPEG or hydroxyPEG (HO-PEG) conjugates of three unrelated proteins were consistent with that classification (Sherman, M.R., et al., 2012. Bioconjug. Chem. 23, 485–499). Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) were performed on rabbit antisera and rabbit monoclonal anti-PEGs with competitors including 10kDa mPEG, 10kDa PEG diol and six linear or cyclic oligomers of oxyethylene (CH2CH2O), with molecular weights of ca. 150–264Da. Our results demonstrate that (1) the binding affinities of anti-mPEGs depend more on the backbone lengths of the polymers and the hydrophobicities of their end-groups than on their resemblance to the methoxy terminus of the immunogenic polymer; (2) anti-PEGs raised against HO-PEG-proteins are not directed against the terminal hydroxy group, but against the backbone; (3) rabbit anti-PEGs bind to and distinguish among PEG-like oligomers with as few as three oxyethylene groups; and (4) none of the monoclonal or polyclonal anti-PEGs was absolutely “methoxy-specific” or “backbone-specific”, but displayed distinct relative selectivities. If these results are relevant to human immune responses, the clinical use of stable conjugates of HO-PEG with proteins and non-protein therapeutic agents would be expected to produce fewer and less intense immune responses than those induced by conjugates with mPEG or PEGs with larger alkoxy groups.},

Most models of technology acceptance focus on barriers of successful information technology implementation in organisations and technologies that have already been deployed. There is only a small number of studies conducted on emerging and disruptive technologies such as AV. We address this issue by deriving context-related determinants from an extensive literature analysis and further describing a technology acceptance modeling process to provide an explanation for drivers’ and factors influencing people behavioural intention to accept AV technology. Based on our evaluation we take the determinants self-efficacy, perceived safety, trust, anxiety and legal regulation into consideration. The outcome and main contribution of this paper is the proposal of a theoretical AV technology acceptance model (AVTAM). This study concluded that the performance of these AV technologies, their safety on the road and consumer’s trust for the AV manufacturers will play a very important role for mass AV adoption.},

  abstract = {Poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) is often attached to compounds to increase serum half-life, reduce immunogenicity, and enhance bioavailability. Accurate and sensitive quantification of PEG conjugates is critical for product development, pharmacokinetic measurements, and efficacy studies. However, PEGylated compounds can be difficult to quantify due to epitope masking by PEG. We previously generated two monoclonal antibodies to PEG (AGP3, IgM and E11, IgG) for quantitative detection of PEGylated proteins. We now report the identification of two second-generation mAbs to PEG (AGP4, IgM and 3.3, IgG) that bind to the repeating subunits of the PEG backbone and facilitate more sensitive quantification of a wider range of PEGylated compounds. A sandwich ELISA in which AGP4/3.3-biotin was employed as the capture/detection antibodies allowed quantification of PEG-Qdot 525 with 14−50-fold greater sensitivity than the original AGP3/E11 combination. Pegasys (PEG-interferon alpha-2a), PEG-Intron (PEG-interferon alpha-2b), Neulasta (PEG-G-CSF), and Lipo-Dox (PEGylated liposomal doxorubicin) could also be quantified with low ng/mL detection limits. The assay tolerated the presence of 50\% human serum or 20\% free PEG molecules. These new anti-PEG antibodies appear useful for qualitative and quantitative analysis of a wide range of PEGylated compounds.}

We present findings from analysis of data on “Hopes \& Fears” surrounding AVs at a one-day symposium that was co-sponsored by an insurance company and included among its attendees a wide range of transportation professionals including those from industry.},

  abstract = {With the extensive growth in usage of cars, the newly produced cars are unable to reach the customers for various reasons like high prices, less availability, financial incapability, and so on. Hence the used car market is escalated across the globe but in India, the used car market is in a very nascent stage and mostly dominated by the unorganized sector. This gives chance for fraud while buying a used car. Hence a high precision model is required which will estimate the price of an used car with none bias towards customer or merchandiser.In this model, A Supervised learning-based Artificial Neural Network model and Random Forest Machine Learning model are developed which can learn from the car dataset provided to it. This project presents a working model for used car price prediction with a low error value. A considerable number of distinct attributes are examined for reliable and accurate predictions. The results obtained agree with theoretical predictions and have shown improvement over models which use simple linear models. An ANN (Artificial Neural Network) is built by using Keras Regression algorithm namely Keras Regressor and other Machine Learning Algorithms namely Random Forest, Lasso, Ridge, Linear regressions are built. These algorithms are tested with the car dataset. Experimental results have shown that the Random Forest model with a Mean Absolute Error value of 1.0970472 and R2 error value of 0.772584 has given the less error among all the other algorithms. The work presented here has shown profound implications for future studies of Used Cars price Prediction using Random Forest and might one day help to solve the problem of fraudswith one hundred percent accuracy.},

  abstract = {Polymer–protein interactions are crucial for determining the activity of both polymer and protein for many bio-related applications. Poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) as a well-known antifouling material is often coated on surfaces to form highly solvated brushes, which exhibit excellent protein-repellent properties. However, unlike surface-induced antifouling effects, little is known about the intrinsic PEG–protein interactions in aqueous solution, which is an important yet neglected problem. Here, we investigate the interactions between PEG and proteins in aqueous solution using fluorescence spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy (AFM), and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Two important characteristics, molecular weight of PEG and mass ratio of PEG : protein, are examined to determine the effect of each on PEG–protein interactions as well as binding characteristics between PEG and proteins. In contrast to too long and too short PEG chains, collective results have shown that PEG with optimal molecular weight (MW) is more capable of interacting with proteins, which induces the conformational change of proteins through more stable binding sites and stronger interactions with long chain PEG. Enhanced PEG–protein interactions are likely due to the change of hydrophilicity to amphiphilicity of PEG with increasing MWPEG. In contrast to almost none or weak interactions of PEG surfaces with proteins, this work provides new evidence to demonstrate the existence of interactions between PEG and proteins in aqueous solution, which is important not only for better understanding of the structure–activity relationship of PEG both in solution and on surfaces, but also for the rational design of new PEG-based materials for specific applications.},

  abstract = {With the rapid expansion of the second-hand vehicle market, correctly forecasting car prices is essential for both researchers and industry experts. The paper initially reviews existing machine learning models and their performance in predicting luxury car prices, emphasizing both their strengths and limitations. To begin with, models like XGBoost and Random Forest excel at processing large-scale data and identifying complex feature patterns, thanks to their ability to use an ensemble of decision trees to reduce bias and variance. However, these models struggle to accurately capture the unique characteristics of luxury vehicles, such as brand reputation, rarity, and personalized configurations. Because these complex factors cannot be easily represented by simple numerical features, the result is often suboptimal predictions for high-value vehicle prices. The paper found that feature engineering could enhance model performance by introducing more representative attributes specific to luxury vehicles, such as brand reputation, rarity, and customization options. Additionally, stratified modeling, which segments data based on price tiers, may provide more accurate predictions by targeting different price levels, especially in the high-value vehicle segment. Despite these theoretical benefits, the paper acknowledges that while these strategies were discussed, they were not empirically tested in detail. Consequently, their practical effectiveness still requires further investigation.},
