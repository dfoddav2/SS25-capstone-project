  abstract = {Due to the large growth in the number of cars being bought and sold, used-car price prediction creates a lot of interest in analysis and research. The availability of used cars in developing countries results in an increased choice of used vehicles, and people increasingly choose used vehicles over new ones, which causes shortages. There is an important need to explore the enormous amount of valuable data generated by vehicle sellers. All sellers usually have the imminent need of finding a better way to predict the future behavior of prices, which helps in determining the best time to buy or sell, in order to achieve the best profit. This paper provides an overview of data-driven models for estimating the price of used vehicles in the Croatian market using correlated attributes, in terms of production year and kilometers traveled. In order to achieve this, the technique of data mining from the online seller ``Nju{\v s}kalo'' was used. Redundant and missing values were removed from the data set during data processing. Using the method of supervised machine learning, with the use of a linear regression algorithm for predicting the prices of used cars and comparing the accuracy with the classification algorithm, the purpose of this paper is to describe the state of the vehicle market and predict price trends based on available attributes. Prediction accuracy increases with training the model with the second data set, where price growth is predicted by linear regression with a prediction accuracy of 95\%. The experimental analysis shows that the proposed model predicts increases in vehicle prices and decreases in the value of vehicles regarding kilometers traveled, regardless of the year of production. The average value of the first data set is a personal vehicle with 130,000 km traveled and a price of EUR 10,000. The second set of data was extracted 3 months after the previously analyzed set, and the average price of used vehicles increased by EUR 1391 per vehicle. On the other hand, average kilometers traveled decreased by 8060 km, which justifies the increase in prices and validates the training models. The price and vehicle type are features that play an important role in predicting the price in a second-hand market, which seems to be given less importance in the current literature of prediction models.},

Considerable number of distinct attributes are examined for the reliable and accurate prediction. To build a model for predicting the price of used cars in Bosnia and Herzegovina, we applied three machine learning techniques (Artificial Neural Network, Support Vector Machine and Random Forest). However, the mentioned techniques were applied to work as an ensemble. The data used for the prediction was collected from the web portal autopijaca.ba using web scraper that was written in PHP programming language. Respective performances of different algorithms were then compared to find one that best suits the available data set. The final prediction model was integrated into Java application. Furthermore, the model was evaluated using test data and the accuracy of 87.38\% was obtained.},

However, little is studied on the comparison of using different algorithms in used car price estimation. This paper collects more than 100,000 used car dealing records throughout China to do empirical analysis on a thorough comparison of two algorithms: linear regression and random forest. These two algorithms are used to predict used car price in three different models: model for a certain car make, model for a certain car series and universal model. Results show that random forest has a stable but not ideal effect in price evaluation model for a certain car make, but it shows great advantage in the universal model compared with linear regression. This indicates that random forest is an optimal algorithm when handling complex models with a large number of variables and samples, yet it shows no obvious advantage when coping with simple models with less variables.},

First, the relevant data processing is carried out for the initial recognition features. Then, by training the deep residual network, the predicted results are fused with the original features as new features. Finally, the new feature group is input into the iteration framework for training, the iteration is stopped, and the results are output when the performance reaches the highest value. These experimental results show that the combination of the deep residual network and iterative framework has a better prediction accuracy than the random forest and deep residual network. At the same time, by combining the existing mainstream methods with the iterative framework, it is verified that the iterative framework proposed in this paper can be applied to other models and greatly improve the prediction performance of other models.},

This model can benefit sellers, buyers, and car manufacturers in the used cars market. Upon completion, it can output a relatively accurate price prediction based on the information that users input. The model building process involves machine learning and data science. The dataset used was scraped from listings of used cars. Various regression methods, including linear regression, polynomial regression, support vector regression, decision tree regression, and random forest regression, were applied in the research to achieve the highest accuracy. Before the actual start of model-building, this project visualized the data to understand the dataset better. The dataset was divided and modified to fit the regression, thus ensure the performance of the regression. To evaluate the performance of each regression, R-square was calculated. Among all regressions in this project, random forest achieved the highest R-square of 0.90416. Compared to previous research, the resulting model includes more aspects of used cars while also having a higher prediction accuracy.},

  abstract = {As the mobile Internet improves by leaps and bounds, the model of traditional offline used car trading has gradually lost the ability to live up to the needs of consumers, and online used car trading platforms have emerged as the times require. Second-hand car price assessment is the premise of second-hand car trading, and a reasonable price can reflect the objective, fair, and true nature of the second-hand car market. In order to standardize the evaluation standards of used car prices and improve the accuracy of used car price forecasts, the linear correlation between vehicle parameters, vehicle conditions, and transaction factors and used car price was comprehensively investigated, grey relational analysis was applied to filter the feature variables of factors affecting used car price, the traditional BP neural network was also optimized by combining the particle swarm optimization algorithm, and a used car price prediction method based on PSO-GRA-BPNN was proposed. The results show that only the correlation coefficient of new car price, engine power, and used car price is greater than 0.6, which has a certain linear correlation. The correlation between new car price, displacement, mileage, gearbox type, fuel consumption, and registration time on used car prices is greater than 0.7, and the impact of other indicators on used car prices is negligible. Compared with the traditional BPNN model and the multiple linear regression, random forest, and support vector machine regression models proposed by other researchers, the MAPE of the PSO-GRA-BPNN model proposed in this paper is 3.936\%, which is 30.041\% smaller than the error of the other three models. The MAE of the PSO-GRA-BPNN model is 0.475, which is a maximum reduction of 0.622 compared to the other three models. R can reach up to 0.998, and R2 can reach 0.984. Although the longest training time is 94.153 s, the overall prediction effect is significantly better than other used car price prediction models, providing a new idea and method for used car evaluation.},

Studies give information about which algorithm is more successful in price prediction using different machine learning methods. The most commonly used method for price prediction is the linear regression model. In our study, we examined the effectiveness of the linear regression model for used car price prediction. In our study, we applied the linear regression model on a data set that includes the features and price information of vehicles in Turkey for the year 2020. As a result, when we selected 1/3 of the data set as the test data, we observed that the R2 score for the prediction success of our model was 73\%. More successful results can be obtained with different data sets or a more detailed data preprocessing.},

  abstract = {Pre-owned automobiles including cars are becoming incredibly popular. There has been a steady increase in automobile production namely, passenger cars over the preceding decade with more than 70 million passenger cars being manufactured in 2016 itself. This has given rise to the resale automobile market, which has become a thriving business in its own right. Customers who are interested in purchasing a pre-owned car frequently face the difficulty in locating a vehicle that fits within their financial constraints as well as estimating the price of a specific pre-owned car. Customers can make more educated decisions regarding the purchase of a pre-owned car if they have access to accurate price projections for pre-owned cars. With the proliferation of digital marketplaces, both the buyer and the seller remain more updated regarding the recent market trends and patterns that impact the value of a used car. In this paper, we investigate this issue and propose a forecasting system using machine learning techniques that enables a prospective buyer to anticipate the price of a pre-owned vehicle of interest. The process is conducted with the collection and pre-processing of a dataset followed by an exploratory data analysis. Various machine learning regression techniques, such as Linear Regression, LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Extreme Gradient Boosting, have subsequently been implemented. The techniques are then compared so as to determine an optimal solution. Three types of errors namely, MAE, MSE and RMSE have also been calculated in order to determine the best-fitted model.},

The objective of this article is to build a generalized model that can predict the price of used cars based on some factors, such as the car's mileage, the year it was made, the road tax, the type of fuel it uses, the size of its engine etc. Optimal model can help sellers, buyers, and car manufacturers. A relatively accurate prediction of price can be made based on information provided by users. Among the seven models, the support vector regressor is the optimal model based on the evaluation metrics such as R Squared (R{\textasciicircum}2) of 95.27\%, Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.142, Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 0.047, and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 0.218 at 90\% of the train data and 10\% of the validation data.},

  abstract = {With the extensive growth in usage of cars, the newly produced cars are unable to reach the customers for various reasons like high prices, less availability, financial incapability, and so on. Hence the used car market is escalated across the globe but in India, the used car market is in a very nascent stage and mostly dominated by the unorganized sector. This gives chance for fraud while buying a used car. Hence a high precision model is required which will estimate the price of an used car with none bias towards customer or merchandiser.In this model, A Supervised learning-based Artificial Neural Network model and Random Forest Machine Learning model are developed which can learn from the car dataset provided to it. This project presents a working model for used car price prediction with a low error value. A considerable number of distinct attributes are examined for reliable and accurate predictions. The results obtained agree with theoretical predictions and have shown improvement over models which use simple linear models. An ANN (Artificial Neural Network) is built by using Keras Regression algorithm namely Keras Regressor and other Machine Learning Algorithms namely Random Forest, Lasso, Ridge, Linear regressions are built. These algorithms are tested with the car dataset. Experimental results have shown that the Random Forest model with a Mean Absolute Error value of 1.0970472 and R2 error value of 0.772584 has given the less error among all the other algorithms. The work presented here has shown profound implications for future studies of Used Cars price Prediction using Random Forest and might one day help to solve the problem of fraudswith one hundred percent accuracy.},

  abstract = {With the rapid expansion of the second-hand vehicle market, correctly forecasting car prices is essential for both researchers and industry experts. The paper initially reviews existing machine learning models and their performance in predicting luxury car prices, emphasizing both their strengths and limitations. To begin with, models like XGBoost and Random Forest excel at processing large-scale data and identifying complex feature patterns, thanks to their ability to use an ensemble of decision trees to reduce bias and variance. However, these models struggle to accurately capture the unique characteristics of luxury vehicles, such as brand reputation, rarity, and personalized configurations. Because these complex factors cannot be easily represented by simple numerical features, the result is often suboptimal predictions for high-value vehicle prices. The paper found that feature engineering could enhance model performance by introducing more representative attributes specific to luxury vehicles, such as brand reputation, rarity, and customization options. Additionally, stratified modeling, which segments data based on price tiers, may provide more accurate predictions by targeting different price levels, especially in the high-value vehicle segment. Despite these theoretical benefits, the paper acknowledges that while these strategies were discussed, they were not empirically tested in detail. Consequently, their practical effectiveness still requires further investigation.},
